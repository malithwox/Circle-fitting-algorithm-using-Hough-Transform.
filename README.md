# Circle-fitting-algorithm-using-Hough-Transform.
Implementation to detect at least three circles with different radius in a image

C = circle_detection (I, R)
Input: I (input image), R (Specific radius of the circles that you want to detect)
Outputs: C (centers i.e. x, y coordinates of the detected circles)
